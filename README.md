Expense Tracker

The Expense Tracker is a simple console-based desktop application (not a website) built with Java and MySQL. It’s designed to help you keep track of daily expenses in an organized way, while also being a great practice project for learning how Java connects with databases.

What it does

Lets you add expenses by entering a category, name, and amount.

Allows you to view all your expenses stored in the database.

Gives you the option to delete expenses when you don’t need them anymore.

Runs on a clean, menu-based interface, so you just choose a number to perform an action.

Why this project

I built this as a basic personal finance manager and also as a way to practice Java + MySQL (JDBC). It’s simple, but useful if you want a starting point for tracking expenses or learning database integration with Java.

Future ideas

In the future, this project could be extended with:

Monthly or weekly reports

Expense summaries by category

A proper GUI instead of console menus

Export options (CSV, PDF, etc.)
